# MA415/MA615 EDA Project Report

Group members: Sijie Shan, Nutthakorn Intharacha, Vala Rahmani, Ran Tao, Yuan Yuan

This is Sijie Shan / CJ 's Github, though.

Instructions on download:

Use the green button on the right to download a zip file. Please do NOT copy directly or right click and 'save link as,' these lazy way of downloading files can sometimes (very badly) corrupt the files.

Create a new folder and put the zip file in it. Upzip the file.

Run the R Markdown file named 'MA415.' Knit it, by default there should (hopefully) be a pdf file.

Remember to upload files to your own GitHub before 12AM tonight.

Also post the link of your GitHub project to your BU BlackBoard.

Let me know if you have any questions. Nice working with you guys.

Good luck,
CJ
