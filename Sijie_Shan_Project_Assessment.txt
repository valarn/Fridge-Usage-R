MA415 Project Assessment

As my first project written using R, I found it not bad. Not brilliant, but not bad.

In this project, I was responsible for things like importing data, coordinating graphs and texts, and exporting outputs. Therefore I wrote the majority of the codes. But here, the only thing I want to talk about is data preparation.

The problem with most beginners to programming is that they are eager to show that 'I can do it' - they want to start scripting right away when they get the data. But on the contrary, most, if not all, of the time of statisticians, is spent understanding and normalizing the data. Analysis is always the last part, only when the data is clean enough.

What I particularly like about the project is the way I was importing and preparing data - one layer by another. I personally like manipulating data in a way that is easy to check if I did something wrong. Therefore, I named the first imported table (right out of Excel) table_0, and then copy to table_1, and manipulate table_1. This way, I am not deteriorating the integrity of raw data. After a few steps of manipulation, I use the same trick and store data to table_2, etc. I found this extremely helpful when checking if the script gives the desired results.

I feel that the project could have been better if we are given enough time - analysis could have been written more comprehensively, and I wanted to produce a tech spec for the project. It later turned out I didn't have enough time.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy the project and thanks for your time. Also my thanks to the help my teammates have provided. It was a pleasure working with them.

Best,
CJ
